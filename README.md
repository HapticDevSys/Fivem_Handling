# Haptic Handling Tool

This FiveM Vehicle Handling Replacement Tool is designed to help server administrators maintain consistent and standardized vehicle handling across all vehicles, whether vanilla or custom. No more worrying about broken car tunings or inconsistent vehicle behavior!

I saw someone selling one similar for $35, so decided to just make my own that lets you be more selective with vehicles.

So i actually lost the source code, so ive uploaded the binaries. Best i could do
